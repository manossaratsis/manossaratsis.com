        <hr>
        <aside>Created at 2019-02-07</aside>
        <article>
          <p>4 years ago, right around the end of the 1st year of graduate school, I made a conscious career decision: to transition from <strong>architecture</strong> to <strong>building science</strong> and <strong>software engineering</strong>.</p>

<p>Over the course of these 4 years, I have been involved in <strong>all stages</strong> of the software development process, from hacking together one-off scripts to process data, to helping stand-up distributed compute infrastructure, to designing and implementing data warehousing systems, APIs, and web applications. It wouldn’t have been possible without the <strong>mentorship and guidance</strong> of <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/jerluc">Jeremy Lucas</a> and <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/sam-steyer">Sam Steyer</a> who I have the pleasure to work with every day at <a href="https://stationa.com">Station A</a>.</p>

<p>As an architect-turned-software engineer, I sometimes ask myself: <em>‘What are the lessons I learned in architecture school that would be translatable to my career in software?’</em>. When I think of building a software product <strong>as a process</strong>, it shares a remarkable number of similarities with the process of designing physical space.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here are some principles I have found to be consistent in both the architectural and the software development process.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="understand-the-user">Understand the user</h2>

<p>Architecture requires deep understanding of the user: you wouldn’t be able to design a house for an occupant (real or hypothetical) you know nothing about. You would have to start by <strong>comprehending their needs</strong>, habits, culture, and aspirations to be in a position to develop a design. Similarly, a good software product needs to be able to address the needs of its users. The day of a product manager is filled with user testing, interviews, and storyboarding for good reason: to ensure that the product makes the user’s life <strong>easier</strong> by addressing a real need.</p>

<p>One of the things I have really come to appreciate about the software process is the <strong>speed of deployment, testing, and iteration</strong>. At <a href="https://stationa.com">Station A</a>, we can put a new product in front of users in a matter of seconds, get them to use it, solicit their feedback and improve upon it. The equivalent process in architecture is <strong>much slower, expensive and limited</strong>: physical models, 3D renderings and VR walkthroughs go a long way but don’t come close to the real experience of a built space.</p>

<h2 id="understand-the-context">Understand the context</h2>

<p>As you can probably tell by <a href="https://manossaratsis.com/research">my research interests</a>, I am a big fan of architectural design <strong>within context</strong>: considering the environmental conditions, cultural fabric, and existing building stock surrounding your design. This doesn’t imply that architecture has to be reactive, but rather that it should seek to <strong>enrich and amplify</strong> its context rather than overshadow or -at the other extreme- be defined by it.</p>

<p>Software products are interesting in that regard: you don’t want your application to just complement an existing process, but to <strong>encourage</strong> users to think about the <em>status quo</em> more creatively, and even slightly upend it. The only way to do this as a product manager is to know your product’s context: competitive products, market trends, and emerging technologies worth looking into.</p>

<h2 id="design-for-maximum-flexibility">Design for maximum flexibility</h2>

<p>Architecture has to be able to adapt to an occupant’s <strong>ever-evolving needs</strong> and way of life. For this reason, an architect needs to design for maximum flexibility, anticipating changing conditions -a couple of examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Flexibile space utilization:</strong> Folding furniture and <em>open</em> floor plans with no fixed partitions to allow easy indoor layout reconfigurations</li>
  <li>
<strong>Flexible shading:</strong> Dynamic shading systems or glazing materials that react to the amount of sunlight they receive to optimize indoor conditions</li>
  <li>
<strong>Flexible facades:</strong> Facades that react to environmental conditions or occupant preferences to alter the performance or appearance of a building</li>
</ul>

<p>Software is very similar: not only does it need to be able to anticipate shifting user needs, but also be designed in a way that allows <strong>easy future additions and enhancements</strong>. At <a href="https://stationa.com">Station A</a>, we embrace flexibility in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Flexible system design:</strong> Building back-end data systems that allow us to ingest and process new datasets fluidly, without the need for customization</li>
  <li>
<strong>Flexible product design:</strong> Designing our product in a way that allows us to easily add new features, expose enhanced data, and iteratively improve on user experience</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leave-room-for-experimentation">Leave room for experimentation</h2>

<p>Experimentation is a <strong>prerequisite to innovation</strong>. Testing a new idea when developing a building design can lead to unexpected revelations. That could be anything from a new way to arrange a floor plan, to a new facade material, to a new natural ventilation or daylighting strategy. In a lot of ways, out-of-the-box thinking is <strong>expected</strong> of architects, and when it’s succesful it can really transform the occupant’s experience of a space.</p>

<p>In the world of software, experimentation is <strong>cheaper and requires less effort</strong>. From testing out a new software technology, to deploying a new <em>beta</em> feature for a select group of users, trying out new things and soliciting feedback is fast. Experimentation lends itself well to the <strong>iterative nature</strong> of the software development process, yet it has to be done in a way that inspires rather than alienates users.</p>
