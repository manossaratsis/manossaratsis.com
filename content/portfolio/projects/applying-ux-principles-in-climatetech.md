> How can we drive climate action using a UX playbook?

For a real estate owner or tenant to take climate action on their building, they need to know what the financial case for clean energy is. The data required to build this case is scattered, convoluted, and hard to comprehend unless you are an expert. At Station A, we are using compelling UX design to gradually educate users and help them craft their climate action plan.

This presentation, [delivered in a panel hosted by Rosenfeld Media](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/sessions/climate-design-product-showcase/?utm_source=Rosenfeld+Media&utm_campaign=3e88382fed-Community+videoconference+recording+3%2F13%2F24&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_-1ad71a84fc-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D&mc_cid=3e88382fed&mc_eid=412ea75da9), provides context on Station A's building evaluation products: [Grades](https://stationa.com/map) and [Portfolios](https://landing.stationa.com/portfolio). It concludes with concrete recommendations for UX designers interested in climate.

After **10+ years** of UX design iterations, I am proud to see these products change [how leading commercial real estate groups](https://stationa.com/buyers#network) take climate action.
