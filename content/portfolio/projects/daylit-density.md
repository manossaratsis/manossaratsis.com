> How can we use daylighting simulations to rewrite zoning laws?

This presentation was developed as the final chapter of my thesis project at [MIT
Architecture](https://architecture.mit.edu/). It uses a number of new environmental design modeling
tools woven together with [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com) workflows to propose a new framework for
performance-aware urban zoning and real estate development.

The project evolved to become a widely cited [journal paper](/research/simulation-based-daylighting-analysis-procedure)
and helped me receive the [Arthur Rotch Special Prize](/bio) for highest academic achievement as a graduating student from [MIT
Architecture](https://architecture.mit.edu/). It also served as a bridge between the 2 disciplinary
groups I was a part of, [Architecture &amp; Urbanism](https://architecture.mit.edu/architecture-urbanism)
and [Building Technology](https://architecture.mit.edu/building-technology).
