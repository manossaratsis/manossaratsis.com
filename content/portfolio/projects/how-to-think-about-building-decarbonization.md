> How can we accelerate building decarbonization projects using a tech playbook?

Building decarbonization is the key to addressing climate change. While clean energy hardware is
getting cheaper, financing is more widely available, and policy incentives are aligned, we're still
not decarbonizing buildings as fast as we could. The issue lies with the data, software, and
workflows required to get decarbonization projects done.

This presentation explains the roots of the issue, introduces Station A as a solution, and describes
lessons learned from building [Station A's product](https://stationa.com/how-it-works) and growing [Station A's user network](https://stationa.com/providers#network).

The journey continues!
