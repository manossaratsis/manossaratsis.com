> What parallels can we draw between generative creative processes and the architectural process?

From the dawn of the digital network revolution until today, Architecture has entered a transitional process.
It seems that gradually, the conditions towards the rise of a new paradigm for design mature.
‘Design 2.0’ will be based on dynamic methods and rules, in order to connect with the ever-changing needs
of the built environment and its users. Quo Vadis?

This project was developed with [Antonis Tzortzis](https://studiotaf.gr) for our Diploma
Dissertation at [NTUA Architecture](https://www.ntua.gr/en/).
