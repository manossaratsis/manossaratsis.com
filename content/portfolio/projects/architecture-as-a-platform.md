> What can an architect do to fight climate change?

In an effort to encourage more architects to join the race to zero emissions, I am attempting
to narrate my journey from architecture to climatetech. The journey is narrated through the prism
of 3 questions and 3 experiments that I have conducted over the years.

I hope that my experience encourages more of my colleagues to unleash their creativity beyond
the limits of the architecture industry.
