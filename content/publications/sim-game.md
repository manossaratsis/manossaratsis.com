## Abstract
This manuscript describes lessons learnt over the course of several years of teaching building performance simulation to architectural students as part of an introductory building science class. Over the course of a term, students are exposed to a design analysis workflow that links architectural massing models in Rhinoceros 3D to Radiance/Daysim and EnergyPlus. Starting with direct shading and window- to-wall ratio studies, the students tackle increasingly complex tasks which culminate in a 90-min simulation game. For the game students compete in pairs to design a 3000m2 office building with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions per floor area in Phoenix, AZ. Playing the game with a class of 18 undergraduate and graduate students during the fall of 2014, eight teams managed to prepare and run between 9 and 53 design variants with final emissions varying between 37 and 64 kgCO2e/m2. The act of learning while playing proved to be an effective way to intellectually engage the students and help them to discover best sustainable design practices for the investigated building type and climate by themselves.
