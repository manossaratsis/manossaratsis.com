## Who I am
I am a software engineer with a background in energy modeling and geospatial analytics. I design and develop software systems to evaluate the impact of distributed energy technologies on buildings, cities, and the electrical grid. I received a Master of Science in Urbanism and Building Technology while conducting research at the MIT Sustainable Design Lab. I have published numerous papers on energy modeling and its implications for urban planning and design. I am currently the Head of Product at [Station A](https://stationa.com), a Bay Area software company automating the development of clean energy.
