## Overview
I am an architect and software engineer with a passion for cities, great software products, and thoughtful design. I have years of experience designing and developing software that enables data-driven climate decisions for buildings and cities. I am currently the Co-Founder and Head of Product at [Station A](https://stationa.com), where I have helped build the core patented technology, scale the software platform, expand the user network, and grow both the SaaS and Marketplace side of the business. I received a Master of Science in Urbanism and Building Technology from MIT while conducting research at the [Sustainable Design Lab](https://web.mit.edu/sustainabledesignlab/). I have published numerous papers on energy modeling and its implications for urban planning and real estate development.

## Experience
