## Who I am

I am an environmental design professional with a background in computational design and architectural engineering. I develop software to optimally locate distributed energy resources across large urban regions. My work integrates geospatial modeling, building performance simulation, and data analytics and visualization. I received a Master of Science in Architecture and Urbanism from MIT while conducting research at the MIT Sustainable Design Lab. I have published numerous papers on energy modeling and its implications for urban planning and design. My current position is Software Product Manager at Station A, NRG's Innovation Implementation group.
