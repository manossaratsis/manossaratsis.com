The truth is I always wanted my very own personal website. The notion of communicating my research as an architect and building scientist to the outside world has always been of interest to me. Procrastination, shifting priorities, lack of will-power all contributed to my work just sitting in my hard drive.

> What is the point of producing a body of work if it's only going to be seen by you and your immediate environment?

My college degree is in architecture. During my college years I would frequently interact with colleagues who would put together elaborate portfolio websites to showcase their studio work. Images of architectural models, short 3D animations and fancy web effects would usually add up to a very pleasant visual experience. But what about the textual content?

## Overcoming my aversion to text

Architects are known to be averse to text: we are taught to communicate through compelling images, not words. We feel much more comfortable sitting in front of Illustrator and cranking out diagrams than putting our thoughts together in plain text. Let me clarify by saying that **I am definitely guilty of text-aversion**.

Aversion to text, however, severly limits the impact of what we do. Professionals from other backgrounds and industries struggle to see the meaning of architectural projects and frequently reduce it to a set of beautiful drawings, or conceptual designs.

Take it from my own experience: two years ago, I started working in the energy industry. I wanted to apply my skills and passion for the built environment towards one of humanities greatest challenges: the proliferation of clean, distributed energy. I quickly realized that to get people thinking creatively about our buildings and cities, my drawings were not enough: I needed clear and succinct definitions of the context, purpose and impact of my work. **So I started writing.**

## Choosing a medium to fit the message

The next step was making my writings visible beyond my immediate environment. And that's where this website comes in.

> I decided to build a content-first, lightweight static-site from scratch.

I wanted my first personal website to reflect the same values: heavy on the content, with clear typography and reader-friendly delivery. I decided to build it with [Nanoc](https://nanoc.ws), a super straight-forward static-site generator. Nanoc allowed me to focus on the content of the website, while managing styles and interactions independently.

In here you will find research papers and projects that I have worked on over the last few years, presented as thoroughly as possible.

## Celebrating work

Hopefully this website will give you a better sense of my work. I really hope more architects and building scientists start adopting writing as means of communicating what they do and why they do it. Rather than storing multi-page presentation PDFs in our dusty hard drives, let's release them to the world, reflect on them, and **celebrate** them as much as we can!
