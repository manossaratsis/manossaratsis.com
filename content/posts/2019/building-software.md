4 years ago, right around the end of the 1st year of graduate school, I made a conscious career decision: to transition from **architecture** to **building science** and **software engineering**.

Over the course of these 4 years, I have been involved in **all stages** of the software development process, from hacking together one-off scripts to process data, to helping stand-up distributed compute infrastructure, to designing and implementing data warehousing systems, APIs, and web applications. It wouldn't have been possible without the **mentorship and guidance** of [Jeremy Lucas](https://jerluc.com) and [Sam Steyer](https://samsteyer.com) who I have the pleasure to work with every day at [Station A](https://stationa.com).

As an architect-turned-software engineer, I frequently ask myself: *'What are the lessons I learned in architecture school that would be translatable to my career in software?'*. When I think of building a software product **as a process**, it shares a remarkable number of similarities with the process of designing physical space.

## Understand the user

Architecture requires deep understanding of the user: you wouldn't be able to design a house for an occupant (real or hypothetical) you know nothing about. You would have to start by **comprehending their needs**, habits, culture, and aspirations to be in a position to develop a design. Similarly, a good software product needs to be able to address the needs of its users. The day of a product manager is filled with user testing, interviews, and storyboarding for good reason: to ensure that the product makes the user's life **easier** by addressing a real need.

One of the things I have really come to appreciate about the software process is the **speed of deployment, testing, and iteration**. Within a matter of seconds we can put a new product in front of users, get them to use it, solicit their feedback and improve upon it. The equivalent process in architecture is **much slower, expensive and limited**: physical models, 3D renderings and VR walkthroughs go a long way but don't come close to the real experience of a built space.

## Understand the context

As you can probably tell by [my research interests](https://manossaratsis.com/research), I am a big fan of architectural design **within context**: considering the environmental conditions, cultural fabric, and existing building stock surrounding your design. This doesn't imply that architecture has to be reactive, but rather that it should seek to **enrich and amplify** its context rather than overshadow or -at the other extreme- be defined by it.

Software products are interesting in that regard: you don't want your application to just complement an existing process, but to **encourage** users to think about the *status quo* more creatively, and even slightly upend it. The only way to do this as a product manager is to know your product's context: competitive products, market trends, and emerging technologies worth looking into.
