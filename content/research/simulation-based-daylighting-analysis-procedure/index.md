## Abstract

Increasing urban density leads to a conflict between space-use efficiency and daylight access. Cities have traditionally relied on zoning guidelines that consist of section-based geometric evaluation techniques and/or hours of access to direct sunlight. However, it is now possible to quantify the performance of detailed design proposals before construction. Annual climate-based daylighting performance metrics for urban environments can be computed accurately, in high spatial resolution and in a timely manner. Given that massing design decisions at the urban planning level may make or break the long-term daylighting potential of a whole neighborhood, the adoption of these tools by zoning boards, developers and urban planners seems particularly relevant. A simulation-based daylighting analysis procedure reveals the capabilities for both formulating more nuanced prescriptive zoning rules as well as for use by design teams. The procedure is used to evaluate the daylighting performance of 50 block typologies in New York City (NYC). The analysis demonstrates that certain urban massing approaches (e.g. pencil towers on a contextual base) outperform conventional massing strategies. A second case study application of an actual city block shows that innovative urban massings can improve access to daylight for the massing itself as well as for neighboring buildings.

## Introduction

Urbanization and urban densification are ubiquitous trends worldwide (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2012). In established US urban centers, increasing densities are widely observed; from downtown redevelopment schemes, to infill projects in lower density areas as well as the densification of de-industrialized zones. The rationale for increasing density ranges from higher economic profitability to enhanced urban-scale sustainability by preserving land and resources, minimizing transportation footprint, and fostering socially cohesive urban communities (Owen 2009). A frequently-asked question is, apart from the parameters that justify density, which parameters should limit it? It has been argued that contextual values such as historic patterns and social ties form part of the equation. Yet, equally crucial and recognized aspects are human well-being and the preservation of access to natural resources such as air and light both within buildings and at street level.

It seems self-evident that urban geometries have a significant impact on individual buildings’ access to natural light. Street orientation and width, surrounding building heights, and urban canyon characteristics all contribute to the amount of direct sunlight and diffuse daylight that a building façade and adjacent street receive. Given that these variables are unlikely to significantly change over time, a neighborhood’s overall urban massing determines the long-term daylighting potential of buildings throughout the neighborhood. While architectural modifications to floor plans, sections and façade designs may locally alter the degree to which this daylighting potential is being exploited, the overall neighborhood performance remains largely constant unless whole street sections are being demolished: Spaces near the bottom of a narrow urban canyon will never receive ample amounts of daylight. Given the finality with which urban massing solutions impact urban daylighting performance, the stakes are high for municipalities to only issue building permits for suitable urban massing proposals. Across the world, cities rely on zoning resolutions for building permitting. These resolutions use easy-to-enforce, time-based, illuminance-based or geometry-based criteria to ensure fair solar access to all buildings and streets. For example, in the Netherlands, a residential building is considered daylit if its principle façade receives 3 hours of direct sunlight between the dates of 21 March and 21 September (MVRDV 2006). In China, national regulations specify internal to external light level ratios for various indoor spaces (‘Standard for daylight design of buildings’, GB/T 50033 2001) and a minimum requirement of sunlight hours in residential buildings (‘Code of Urban Residential Areas Planning & Design’, GB 50180-93 2002) (Lu and Du 2013). New York City is widely considered to be the birthplace of solar access-inspired zoning laws with initial resolutions stemming back to 1916. Indeed, the city’s zoning resolutions have been used as model manuscripts for cities around the world.

Given the significance of zoning resolutions for daylighting design, the primary goal of his manuscript is to propose a simulation-based daylighting analysis procedure for neighborhoods that goes beyond today’s simplified rules. The procedure enables developers, urban planners and cities officials to efficiently evaluate the daylight performance of arbitrary complex neighborhoods. Using New York City as a case study, the procedure is applied to 50 Manhattan-sized protoblock typologies and simulation results are compared against each other as well as against current zoning regulations. In order to further demonstrate the use of the procedure within an actual urban context, it is applied to a block in one of Manhattan’s highest density zoning districts. In the discussion, the authors argue for the procedure’s wider adoption of simulation-based daylight zoning laws worldwide.
